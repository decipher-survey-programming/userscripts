These Scripts allow keyboard shortcuts to be added to navigate around surveys using the chrome web browser.  They also add an alternative to the ctrl+right arrow shortcut in order to better answer questions.

Shortcuts
shift+Right Arrow = Same as Ctrl right arrow but using the script to try to avoid terms and getting caught on validates. Works best when QA codes are on.  Should be able to fill autosums and select questions properly.  
<br/>
<br/>
alt+g = This will try to take the survey for you auto answering each question. This can be cancelled by hitting escape. It will also time-out if it takes longer than 5 seconds for a page to load.
<br/>
<br/>
alt+q = Go to the projects quota page
alt+r = Go to the projects report page
alt+p = Go to the project in portal
alt+s = Go to the given question using start-at= So you can start from a certain question
alt+h = Goes to given question using start-at=, stop-at=, &debug=flow So you can start from a certain question even if it has a condition
alt+t = Start the survey from the beginning
alt+w = Go to the SST page
alt+d = Disable randomization on the current page
alt+number = Will Straighline the given column number for 2d radio questions
shift+Up Arrow = Will fill the current page with answers without clicking the continue button
<br/>
<br/>
shift+Down Arrow = Will click the continue button without answering the current page
QUOTAS
This also adds some functionality to the quotas page to make it easier to edit cells by entering the new values and pressing tab to move to the next available cell.  Escape will cancel the current cell edit and either tab or enter will save the select cell edit.
